# **Basketball_Posture_corrector** 

## Project Overview

The **Basketball Posture Corrector** is a web-based tool designed to help athletes improve their posture and form during basketball practice. The platform provides two key features aimed at enhancing performance and reducing the risk of injury:

1. **Live Posture Detection**: This feature allows users to record live video through their device's camera while performing basketball drills or exercises. The system will analyze the posture in real-time, giving immediate feedback on whether the user's stance or movements are correct.

2. **Video Upload Analysis**: Users can also upload pre-recorded videos, which the system will analyze to provide detailed feedback on their posture. This is especially useful for athletes who want to review their form after practice sessions or games.

This tool is ideal for basketball players at all levels who want to refine their skills, improve their technique, and maintain a healthy posture while training. By offering real-time feedback and post-session analysis, the platform ensures continuous improvement and helps prevent injuries associated with poor posture.
